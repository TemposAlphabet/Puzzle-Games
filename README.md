Download the Tempos_Alphabet.apk file using your android phone.

Even though your phone will say otherwise, the file is completely safe.

It's just my website converted into a native app. It was built using www.WebtoNative.com

You can go to my website www.temposalphabet.com to preview what the app will look like on your phone, if you'd like.





You can still play the apk file on your pc.
Download BlueStacks 👉 https://bstk.me/ujVykf2Uw 
Install the program on your PC. Then open the apk file in BlueStacks.
That'll allow you to download the puzzle game app on your PC!
