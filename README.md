Download the Tempos_Alphabet.apk file using your android phone.

Even though your phone will say otherwise, the file is completely safe.

It's just my website converted into a native app. It was built using www.WebtoNative.com

You can go to my website www.temposalphabet.com to preview what the app will look like on your android, if you'd like.
